Only, when the fish does bite, it doesn't always sink the bobber right away. In order to catch the fish, you have to wait for the fishhook to sink, which can happen anywhere from the first to the fifth boop."

    "<p style=\"font-size: large;\">To gather evidence for this study, I caught 200 fish over the course of a few days in April.</p> I caught every fish that I saw, so that any favoritism based on conditions or size would not skew the data. For each fish, I recorded the information described below. Since I collected the data myself, I can personally attest that there should not be any unfilled columns for any of the rows, and no cleansing should be necessary. However, adding additional, specialized columns might prove helpful.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains 7 relevant columns: <strong>Fish, Boops, Size, Time, Location, Weather, and Value.</strong>\n",
    "### Fish\n",
    "This is the name of the fish (or similar creature) that was caught. Animal Crossing has 80 unique kinds of \"fish,\" plus various other trash items that can be caught. In-game, fish-adjacent creatures such as snapping turtles and frogs are treated the same as fish, and thus will be considered fish for the purposes of this analysis. \n",
    "### Boops\n",
    "As explained previously, a fish \"boops\" the fish hook between 1 and 5 times before sinking it. The connections between this number and external variables such as value and weather, if any, will be the primary subject of investigation. \n",
    "### Size\n",
    "A fish appears in the water as a silhouette before it is caught. These shadows range in size from extra small to extra large. There is, in fact, a size above extra large, but fish of that size are extremely rare and were not encountered during this study. The size of the fish's silhouette is reliably determined by the species of fish. A sea bass, for example, will always appear as an extra large shadow. \n",
    "### Time\n",
    "Certain fish can only be caught at certain times of the day, or certain times of the year. Though it is not apparant from the dataset, all fish were caught during the month of April. Times are recorded in 24-hour time notation.\n",
    "### Location\n",
    "Fish of certain kinds are only available in certain locations. Though there is some overlap (a clifftop river, for example, can host all of the same fish as a normal river, along with fish unique to that location), there is a clear divide between freshwater fish (found in ponds and all river varieties) and saltwater fish (found in the sea and off the pier). Trash can be found everywhere that fish can be. \n",
    "### Weather\n",
    "Some fish are only available in certain weather, such as rain. There is also a general assumption among players that rarer fish appear more commonly in the rain, though I have not been able to find concrete evidence of this online. I will attempt to investigate this with my limited dataset, but dividing the data by weather is likely to create unreasonably small (and therefore unreliable) subsets of data. \n",
    "### Value\n",
    "Though players often refer to \"rare\" fish, there is no codified method of determining fish rariy. I have decided that the closest approximation for rarity, without knowing the in-game spawn probabilities for each fish, is value; that is, the number of bells (currency) they can be sold for at the standard general store. I will use these numbers to create rarity categories, which I will expand on later. \n",

    "Fishing in Animal Crossing ultimately comes down to timing. Without any indication of when the fishhook will sink, catching a fish is purely reactionary. As soon as the fish bites, you have to quickly press 'A' to reel it in. Otherwise, it will slip off your hook and swim away. Beyond that, there isn't much strategy. However, a better understanding of the probabilities behind fishing could add more strategy to what otherwise would be a game of reflexes. <p style=\"font-size: large;\">If I can look at a fish's shadow and know from environmental conditions that it is most likely to sink the fishook on, for example, the third boop, I would be able to plan my timing accordingly.</p>\n",

    "<p style=\"font-size: large;\">Well, lots of things!</p> We primarily want to investigate boop-count, but we can also see where certain fish appear, or dial-in on certain aspects of fishing.
